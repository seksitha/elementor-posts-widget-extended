# Extended Elementor posts widget with Ajax AngularJs
## Why I do it myself
use elementor pro to build a site. a few bugs and lack of features with posts widget bothers me. \
This solve 2 years of [elementor pro request](https://github.com/elementor/elementor/issues/1284) that's not getting fixed\
To my curiosity and a learning experience, Why not fixing that bugs and add my own needs. After three weeks, from knowing little to a fully custom plugin. the project is really rewarded:smiley: 



## let's get to the widget (It's free for everyone)

you can just [download](https://github.com/seksitha/elementor-posts-widget-extended/archive/master.zip) the project file with the zip file and install it to your Wordpress site. 
activate  `jaxer element` plugin. In pagebuilder, look for the `basic` category name `Jaxer Posts`. activate and enjoy!!!

If you like it please star it. and please give feedback and report issue if any.

## I'm open for the job opportunity as a self-taught :bowtie:
Iâ€™m a self-taught. So this is a learning experience and it is a really satisfying result. Printing 3000 lines of code trying to understand the widget from the ground up and using AngularJS to add functionality. This is what I like to do. 
contact me if you curious about who I am as a coder : seksitha@gmail.com.\
