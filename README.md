# Extended Elementor posts widget with Ajax AngularJs
## How I do it myself
use elementor pro to build a site. a few bugs and lack of features with posts widget bothers me. To my curiosity and a learning experience, Why not fixing that bugs and add my own needs. After three weeks, from knowing little to a fully custom plugin. the project is really rewarded:smiley: 



## let's get to the widget (It's free for everyone)

you can just download the project file with the zip file and install it to your Wordpress site. If you like it please star it. and please give feedback and report issue if any.


### A video demo the plugin LOL :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## I'm open for the job opportunity as a self-taught :bowtie:
Iâ€™m a self-taught. So this is a learning experience and it is a really satisfying result. Printing 3000 lines of code trying to understand the widget from the ground up and using AngularJS to add functionality. This is what I like to do. 
contact me if you curious about who I am as a coder : seksitha@gmail.com.
