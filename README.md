# Extended Elementor posts widget with Ajax AngularJs
## How the project born
I was so impressed with elementor page builder when I asked for the first time to migrate a website from a friend of mind to WordPress.  But after working with it for 2 days to build up the site and found a few bugs and lack of feature even we had the pro version with posts widget. To my curiosity, Why not fixing that bugs and add my own needs. After three weeks, from knowing nothing to a fully custom plugin :smiley: 

## I'm open for the job opportunity as a self-taught :bowtie:
Iâ€™m a self-taught. So this is a learning experience and it is a really satisfying result. Printing 3000 lines of code trying to understand the widget from the ground up and using AngularJS to add functionality. This is what I like to do. 
contact me if you curious about who I am as a coder : seksitha@gmail.com.

## Enought talking let's get to the widget (It's free for everyone)

you can just download the project file with the zip file and install it to your Wordpress site. If you like it please star it. and please give feedback and report issue if any.
