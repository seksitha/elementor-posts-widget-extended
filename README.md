## 18-Aug-2019 fix android issue not loading please [download](https://github.com/seksitha/elementor-posts-widget-extended/releases/download/1.0.1/jaxer-element.zip) and reinstall
## Why I do it myself
use elementor pro to build a site. a few bugs and lack of features with posts widget bothers me. \
This solve 2 years of [elementor pro request](https://github.com/elementor/elementor/issues/1284) that's not getting fixed\
To my curiosity and a learning experience, Why not fixing that bugs and add my own needs. From knowing little to a fully custom plugin. the project is really rewarded:smiley: 



## let's get to the widget (It's free for everyone)

you can just [download](https://github.com/seksitha/elementor-posts-widget-extended/releases/download/1.0.1/jaxer-element.zip) here and install it to your Wordpress site. 
activate  `jaxer element` plugin. In pagebuilder, look for the `basic` category name `Jaxer Posts`. activate and enjoy!!!
